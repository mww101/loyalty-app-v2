# Loyalty App

This repository contains a minimal SwiftUI application skeleton targeting iOS 18. The project is structured as a Swift Package so it can be opened directly in Xcode.

## Getting Started

1. Open `Package.swift` in Xcode 18 or later.
2. Xcode will generate an iOS application project from the package.
3. Build and run on the iOS 18 simulator or a device.

The app includes a single `ContentView` presented from `LoyaltyAppApp`.
